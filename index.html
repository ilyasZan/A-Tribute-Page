          <h3 class="article-title">Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li class="list-item">1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li class="list-item">

            <li class="list-item">
              1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation
              Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of
              this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">

              Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who
              teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.
              Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control
              malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
            </li>

            <li class="list-item">1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
            <li class="list-item">
              1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,
              and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his
              team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
              varieties for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American
              breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95%
              of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian
              subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
              population
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

              yields
            </li>

              1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
            </li>
            <li class="list-item">
              2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that
              genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of
              arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
              genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it
              science, people were selecting the best breeds."
